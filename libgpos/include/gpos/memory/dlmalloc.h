/*
 A malloc_state holds all of the bookkeeping for a space.
 The main fields are:

 Top
 The topmost chunk of the currently active segment. Its size is
 cached in topsize.  The actual size of topmost space is
 topsize+TOP_FOOT_SIZE, which includes space reserved for adding
 fenceposts and segment records if necessary when getting more
 space from the system.  The size at which to autotrim top is
 cached from mparams in trim_check, except that it is disabled if
 an autotrim fails.

 Designated victim (dv)
 This is the preferred chunk for servicing small requests that
 don't have exact fits.  It is normally the chunk split off most
 recently to service another small request.  Its size is cached in
 dvsize. The link fields of this chunk are not maintained since it
 is not kept in a bin.

 SmallBins
 An array of bin headers for free chunks.  These bins hold chunks
 with sizes less than MIN_LARGE_SIZE bytes. Each bin contains
 chunks of all the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart.  To simplify
 use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as a malloc_chunk
 pointing to the real first node, if it exists (else pointing to
 itself).  This avoids special-casing for headers.  But to avoid
 waste, we allocate only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use
 repositioning tricks to treat these as the fields of a chunk.

 TreeBins
 Treebins are pointers to the roots of trees holding a range of
 sizes. There are 2 equally spaced treebins for each power of two
 from TREE_SHIFT to TREE_SHIFT+16. The last bin holds anything
 larger.

 Bin maps
 There is one bit map for small bins ("smallmap") and one for
 treebins ("treemap).  Each bin sets its bit when non-empty, and
 clears the bit when empty.  Bit operations are then used to avoid
 bin-by-bin searching -- nearly all "search" is done without ever
 looking at bins that won't be selected.  The bit maps
 conservatively use 32 bits per map word, even if on 64bit system.
 For a good description of some of the bit-based techniques used
 here, see Henry S. Warren Jr's book "Hacker's Delight" (and
 supplement at http://hackersdelight.org/). Many of these are
 intended to reduce the branchiness of paths through malloc etc, as
 well as to reduce the number of memory locations read or written.

 Segments
 A list of segments headed by an embedded malloc_segment record
 representing the initial space.

 Address check support
 The least_addr field is the least address ever obtained from
 MORECORE or MMAP. Attempted frees and reallocs of any address less
 than this are trapped (unless INSECURE is defined).

 Magic tag
 A cross-check field to validate pointers to malloc_state.

 Flags
 Bits recording whether to use MMAP, locks, or contiguous MORECORE

 Statistics
 Each space keeps track of current and maximum system memory
 obtained via MORECORE or MMAP.
